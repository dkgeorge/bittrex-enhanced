"Bittrex Enhanced" --- A chrome extension that enhances Bittrex by providing USD and BTC values alongside BTC, USDT &amp; ETH, and swaps chart with TradingView widget

This was the best extension for Bittrex. Unfortunately it seems CryptoNirvana is not updating it anymore :(

To install in Firefox just download the signed xpi at https://github.com/dkgeorge/bittrex-enhanced/releases

For Chrome, download the extension from master as a .zip by looking for the “Download ZIP” button on the right-hand side of the project page on GitHub. Now extract/unzip the code somewhere. Then in Chrome go to Menu (the three lines)->More tools->Extensions. Click the “Developer mode” checkbox and then click the button labeled “Load unpacked extension…”.
